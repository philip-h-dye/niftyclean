	* Resolved spurious stringop-overflow warning for strcpy() into the
	  classic scenario of a buffer tacked onto the end of a structure
	  via byte array of length 1.  Added -Wno-stringop-overflow.
	  GCC 11.2.0  CYGWIN_NT-10.0 3.3.3(0.341/5/3)

2005-02-17  Charles Swiger  <chuck@pkix.net>
	* fix Makefile usage of "make install", setting $INSTALL if need be
	* move globals into main.c and prototype them only once in niftyclean.h
	* clean up some header file includes and datatypes (ie, time_t usage)
	* use sysexit return codes
	* remove antiquated .u object type, add .pyc/.pyo for Python
	* make default-lists NULL terminated rather than fixed-size
	* update manpage and other docs
	
2003-07-19  Charles Swiger  <chuck@pkix.net>
	* ran against gcc33 -Wall and fixed most warnings (except syscall dcls)

2003-07-04  Charles Swiger  <chuck@pkix.net>
	* updated Makefile to respond to "make clean" vs "make distclean"
	* added backslash prefix to #*# entry in manpage
	(obviously one needs to be able to comment out a comment in regexs)
	* cleaned up a few comments, updated version numbers so the program
	version it displays will correspond with the SF release number.
	* added FreeBSD package files: /usr/ports/sysutils/clean
	
2003-06-03  Charles Swiger  <chuck@pkix.net>
	* moved ChangeLog out of main.c into this file
	* updated Makefile to pay attention to CFLAGS, CC, etc
	* ANSI-fied and added prototypes to fix most warnings
	* wrote a manpage (ouch, nroff) and fixed Makefile-based install so
	  that I could build a FreeBSD package properly

21-Nov-89: Hey, This program really works!!!!
I (Mike) realize this as I put a new line in my .logout
with the proper arguments to delete my ENTIRE account (by accident)
boy was I surprised the next time I logged in (Mike)

First release: 23-Nov-89 Version 2.1

25-Nov-89: Added -V flag, changed linked lists to do insertion
at head of list, converted list structures to end in one
character arrays for less malloc's, eliminated keeping track of
volumes if no volume flags are on, implemented QUIET mode. (Jay)

Second release: 29-Nov-89 Version 2.2

6-Dec-89: Emergency patch to fix a bug with multiple directories
and mount point switches -w -r and -a. (Jay)

Third release: 6-Dec-89 Version 2.2.1

3-Jan-90: Added -t switch to only remove files more than one day
old.  Also, removed ERROR in favor of FATAL for the error handling,
and converted the malloc() errors from INTERNAL to FATAL. (Jay)

13-Jan-90: Added -x and -X switch for excluding directories, and
altered the parsing of the .cleanrc appropriately.  Changed -t
switch to take an argument (number of days).  Removed -m switch
since it can be re-done with -xX. (Jay)

16-Jan-90: Cleaned up the usage for the new version. (Jay)

Fourth release: ????? Version 2.3

13-Feb-90: Fixed a minor bug with one character directory names.
(Jay)

Fifth release: 13-Feb-90 Version 2.4

20-Feb-90: At Mark Held's request, I am commenting out the -r and
	-a switches (read-only and backup volume traversal) (Jay)

Sixth release: 21-Feb-90 Version 2.5

circa 1991: I picked this program up from the CMU computer
club and started munging it to run under NEXTSTEP.  I added the ability
to recognize directory trees to be terminated, and to perform directory
pruning in the middle of traversal for the NeXT directory-wrapper
convention. (Chuck)
